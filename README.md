# Earth Information Center Mobile Concept Application

The Earth Information Center Mobile application concept is a custom application that uses NASA SVS videos for visualization and image services for analysis. By tying the visualizations to the underlying data in a custom application, NASA Earth data becomes more accessible and easier to understand for the public. The application provides the most up-to-date information as the underlying services are updated by dynamically reading the configured video and image services. And finally, this application offers a mobile-first experience, allowing anyone to explore the application in its entirety from their mobile device 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Before deploying outside of testing, you will want to configure the ```config.json``` file to point the application to the proper video and image service endpoints.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) - Version Control System
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) - Version Control System
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) - JavaScript Runtime Environment
* [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Web Framework

### Installing

Clone the GitHub Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/cwaltsgeo/EIC-Mobile.git
```

Navigate to the ```EIC-Mobile``` project folder

```
cd EIC-Mobile
```

Install the ```EIC-Mobile``` project dependencies

```
npm install

Test in dev mode

```
npm run dev
```

## Git Workflow

This project follows a Gitflow branching model:

- Feature/Bugfix Branches: Start development from a feature or bugfix branch. Use a meaningful branch name like feature/your-feature or bugfix/your-bugfix.

- Pull Request to Development Branch: When your work is ready, open a pull request (PR) from your feature or bugfix branch to the development branch.

- Staging Deployment: Once the PR is merged into the development branch, the changes will automatically be deployed to the staging environment for further testing.

- Production Deployment: If the changes in staging are approved, open a PR from the development branch to the main branch. Upon merging, the changes will be deployed to the production environment.

## Branch Protection Rules
- Development Branch: The development branch is protected, and direct commits are not allowed. All changes must come through pull requests.

- Main Branch: The main branch is also protected and only accepts pull requests from the development branch.

## Configuration

The ```config.json``` file is a vital metadata file that points the application to the proper video and image service endpoints. For the application to run properly, itâ€™s important to configure the file according to the following parameters.

| Property | Data Type | Description|
|----------|----------|----------|
| ```name```            | string    | Layer Name                                                        |
| ```description```     | string    | Layer Description                                                 |
| ```unit```            | string    | Unit of Measurement                                               |
| ```video```           | string    | Video Service endpoint                                            |
| ```service```         | string    | Image Service REST endpoint                                       |
| ```wcs```             | boolean   | Value determines if service is or is not OGC WCS                  |
| ```wcsParams```       | dict      | A dictionary of required parameters to request an OGC WCS service |
| ```active```          | boolean   | Value determines what layer is or is not visible                  |
| ```vitals```          | dict      | A dictionary of summary statistics from the Image Service         |
| ```tour```            | list      | A list of stops for the layer's Guided Tour                       |

## Deployment

In order to deploy this application to a live system, you'll need to first establish the following architecture:

* [ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/) - Image Services
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - Video Services
* [AWS S3 + CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/deploy-a-react-based-single-page-application-to-amazon-s3-and-cloudfront.html) - Application Deployment


Configure ```config.json``` with the proper metadata and service endpoints

```
vi ./src/config.json
```

Build the project ```dist``` folder

```
npm run build
```

Upload the project ```dist``` folder to AWS S3

```
aws s3 sync ./dist s3://<your-bucket-name>/ 
```
